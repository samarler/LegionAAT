Star Wars Legion ATT Lighted and Motorized Modification

Modify a Star Wars Legion ATT to motorize the main turret and side weapons which are controled by a remote controller conneceted over BTLE. 
The ATT is uses an Adafruit Feather 32u4 Bluefruit to recieve and execute commands.

Included in this repository are stl files for printing out parts needed to complete the modification, a circuit diagram and the code for the Adafruit Feather 32u4 Bluefruit along with instructions on how to complete the modification.
