PROJECT DOCUMENTATION IS NOT YET COMPLETE

Star Wars Legion ATT Motorized Modification

The idea of the project is to use a Raspberry PI Zero W as a controller to move the turret and side guns of a Star Wars Legion ATT. The ATT's side guns and turret are connected to low speed motors which are controlled by an Adafruit Feather RF52 Bluefruit LE. Connectivity between the PI and Feather uses Bluetooth.

Most parts are available from Adafruit.
